# Javascript-Game

An image is randomly generated in a canvas.
When the image is clicked, it respawns in another randomly generated location.
Your score is calculated by counting the number of clicks on the image.
The average time between clicks is the total time passed since the first click divided by your score.
The game displays a "Game Over" message displaying the score and average time.
It has a "resart game" button and "help" button which gives information on how to play the game.
